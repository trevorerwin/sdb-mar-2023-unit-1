    <h2>South Hadley, MA</h2>
    <p>
      I joined this course because I want to augment my skills as a software engineer. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, but COVID-19 put a dent in things for me, and I lost some
      knowledge during this time. So hopefully during my time here, I'll rebuild my confidence and relearn the skills I need to land a job.

      <h1>Two Truths and a Lie</h1>
      <h3>I was an extra in the movie "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"</h3>
      <p>I was one of the people running in terror at the start of the film, when the big eyeball creature shows up</p>
      <h3>I met Regis Philbin, the host of Who wants to be a millionaire, in New York City</h3>
      <p>I was on a field trip in Middle School and our class saw him walking about, and I got a picture with him</p>
      <h3>I was followed by a black bear at my local dog park</h3>
      <p>I took my goldendoodle Maverick to the dog park, where he noticed a black bear about 100 feet behind us, and it was... quite spooky</p>
